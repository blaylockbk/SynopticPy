Synoptic's [Weather API](https://synopticdata.com/weatherapi/) gives you access to real-time and historical surface-based weather and environmental observations for thousands of stations. Synoptic's [open access data](https://synopticdata.com/pricing/open-access-pricing/) is _free_. More data and enhanced services are also available.

I wrote these functions to conveniently request data from [Synoptic's Weather API](https://docs.synopticdata.com/services/weather-data-api) and convert the JSON data to a **[Polars DataFrame](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/getting-started/)**. I'm sharing this as an open source project because I think these might be helpful to others who are getting started using the Synoptic API with Python. I also wrote this package to get more experimence using Polars DataFrames.


> ### üéüÔ∏è You will need an API token before using SynopticPy: [Register for a free Synoptic account](https://customer.synopticdata.com/).

If you have stumbled across this package, I hope it is useful to you or at least gives you some ideas.

**Best of Luck üçÄ**
