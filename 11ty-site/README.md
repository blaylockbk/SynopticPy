# Developer Guide

**TL;DR** To build the pages, do the following:

1. Install Node.js (version 16+). I did this with conda using
   ```
   conda create --name synoptic -c conda-forge nodejs
   conda activate synoptic
   ```
   And add npm to your PATH
   ```
   # e.g., in ~/.bashrc
   export PATH=/home/blaylock/miniconda3/envs/synoptic/bin:$PATH
   ```
2. `cd 11ty-site` - Every time
3. `npm install` - Do once, or anytime a NPM dependency changes
4. `npm run dev` - Builds the full site in _develop mode_, (not tracked by Git).
5. `npm run dev:site` - Builds the site without PyScript in _develop mode_, (not tracked by Git).
6. ~~`npm run build` - Builds the full site in _production mode_, (tracked by Git).~~ Do NOT run this command; the page build is instead completed by GitHub Actions (./github/workflows/static.yml)

# SynopticPy App Organization

The web app is built using the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator with [Nunjucks](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/nunjucks/) as the template language.

## Folder Structure
```bash
ðŸ“‚11ty-site/
 â”œâ”€ðŸ“‚dev/            # The local site build; not tracked by git; DO NOT EDIT
 â”œâ”€ðŸ“‚node_modules/   # Node dependencies installed with `npm install`
 â”œâ”€ðŸ“‚pages/          # Holds the content of the website
 â”‚  â”œâ”€ðŸ“‚_data/           
 â”‚  â”œâ”€ðŸ“‚_includes/     
 â”‚  â”œâ”€ðŸ“‚app/          # HTML, CSS, Python, fonts, etc. that make the webpage

## VS Code Tasks

There are two VS Code tasks to help you test the webpage before it is deployed. 

> Note:These assume you have nodejs installed in a conda environment named `synoptic`.

1. <kbd>Build 11ty - Develop</kbd> Will build the site in "develop" mode and serve the page to <http://localhost:8080/> so you can preview changes to the site as you are working on the app.
1. <kbd>Build 11ty - Develop (pyscript off)</kbd> Does the same as above, except it turns of loading pyscript. This is useful if you are working on the UI and don't need to test the pyscript functionality.
