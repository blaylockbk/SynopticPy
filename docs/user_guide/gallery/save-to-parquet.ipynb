    "# ðŸ’¾ Save to Parquet\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parquet format is an efficient file format to save Synoptic's data.\n",
    "If I need to reuse data over many times (i.e., researching a case study) then I don't want to keep asking Synoptic for the data; I want to get the data and save it to local disk. Also, Synoptic restricts how much data you can retrieve in a single API request. If you need long a long time series then you will need to make multiple API calls. You should save the DataFrame information to a Parquet file to save disk space and most performant loading time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_What are the benefits of saving Synoptic's data to Parquet instead of the raw JSON?_**\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the benefits of Parquet, let's collect a timeseries of 5 days of data for all the stations within 10 miles of WBB.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write the raw JSON to a JSON file.\n",
    "1. Write the Polars DataFrame to a Parquet file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How large is the JSON file versus Parquet file? _Parquet is about 18x smaller than JSON, because it is efficiently compressed._\n",
    "- How long does it take to load a JSON file versus Parquet file? _Parquet is faster to load into memory, it's already organized in a clean table, you can read only select rows if you want, and it's easy to read multiple files at a time._\n"
