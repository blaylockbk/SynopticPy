# 👨🏻‍🏭 Contribute

This package is a work in progress, a sandbox, a personal laboratory. It is distributed _as is_. Any revisions I make are purely for my experimentation and benefit.

With that said, I am happy to share this project with you and hope you find it useful. You are welcome to open issues and submit pull requests, but know that I may or may not get around to doing anything about it. I will review pull requests when time permits.

If this is helpful to you in any way, I'm glad.
