# 👨🏻‍🏭 Contributing Guidelines

This package is a work in progress, a sandbox, a personal laboratory. It is distributed _as is_. Any revisions I make are purely for my experimentation and benefit.

With that said, I am happy to share this project with you. You are welcome to open issues and submit pull requests, but know that I may or may not get around to doing anything about it. I'm open to reviewing pull requests when time permits.

If this is helpful to you in any way, I'm glad.
