The `Synoptic Mesonet API <https://synopticdata.com/mesonet-api>`_ (formerly MesoWest) gives you access to real-time and historical surface-based weather and environmental observations for thousands of stations. Synoptic data access is `free <https://synopticdata.com/news/2022/3/15/synoptic-data-pbc-launches-new-open-access-weather-data-service>`_ for open-access data. More data and enhances services are available through a `paid tier <https://synopticdata.com/pricing>`_ (available through Synoptic, not me).

.. note::

I wrote these functions to conveniently access data from the Synoptic API and convert the JSON data to a `Pandas DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/>`_. This may be helpful to others who are getting started with the Synoptic API and Python. The idea is loosely based on the obsolete `MesoPy <https://github.com/mesowx/MesoPy>`_ python wrapper, but returning the data as a Pandas DataFrame instead of a simple dictionary, making the retrieved data more ready-to-use.


If you have stumbled across this package, I hope it is useful to you or at least gives you some ideas.

**Best of Luck üçÄ**
